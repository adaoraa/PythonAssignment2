This file will compute the greatest common denominator and Ackermann functions, given their current arguments.
The gcd function currently has arguments 12 and 15, while the Ackermann function currently has arguments 1, 1.
To successfully compile this file, I am using Pycharm. Any other IDE should work as well as text editors such as
notepad++. However, you will have to run commands through a terminal such as putty to access the file.

If the program has run and compiled properly, it should read:

the first argument is  12
the second argument is  15
The greatest common denominator of these 2 integers is as follows:
3
the first argument is  1
the second argument is  1
The Ackermann function for these arguments is as follows:
A(1, 1)
A(0, A(1, 0))
A(0, A(0, 1))
A(0, 2)
The Ackermann function was invoked 4 times

Process finished with exit code 0
